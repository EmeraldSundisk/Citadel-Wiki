The Botanist
===

**The Botanist**, as you can imagine, grows and tends to plants. Although you answer to the [Head of Personnel](/citadel-wiki/main/roles/command/head_of_personnel.md) and will likely be working with the [Cook](/citadel-wiki/main/roles/service/cook.md) and [Bartender](h/citadel-wiki/main/roles/service/bartender.md) most of the time, you can grow things for other departments and even the station at large. In a way, their job resembles the very thing they work with - easy to understand at a base level but there's a lot more to it beneath the surface.

## NT_Hydro
No matter what you grow, you can expect it to be in a hydroponics tray. This not only spares you from getting "down and dirty" but also makes it far easier to assess a plant's condition! **Just remember the following color code:**

- Green: Plant is ready to harvest!
- Red: Plant is unhealthy.
- Red, flashing: Plant is either competing with weeds or pests.
- Yellow: Plant lacks nutrient.
- Blue: Plant lacks water.

Plants should be harvested regularly, especially perennials that can provide multiple harvests in their lifetime. Water should be self-explanatory. ...

To avoid running out of seeds, you should insert part of your harvests into the seed extractor, as it will produce at least one seed pack of whatever you put in it. You can even put these packs into the extractor for future use, which will not only grant you a tidier workplace but also provide additional info on the seeds inside!

## Photosynthesis: Hacked

From humble acorns mighty oaks may grow, but nobody in the 26th century has time to wait for that. Fortunately it's become possible to create incredible plants from the get-go by **extracting traits from other seeds**. All you need is a plant data disk and a pack of seeds you're willing to lose.

Slap both into...

In addition to your conventional stats, there's ...

## Grow-A-Guy Garden - Podpeople

If the idea of manipulating plant genes bothers you, **it only gets worse**. When you get a brainless and/or headless corpse sent your way, odds are it's not for composting - with Replica Pods, you can succeed where the medical team /failed/. If you can extract blood from the body via a syringe, squirt it into a pack of replica pod seeds and plant them. Keep it growing and if the spirit of the deceased is around, soon enough you'll have a /podperson/ on your hands!

If they're walking and talking you can consider it a success, regardless whether or not anyone else does. Even if they're unhappy with their new form, the important thing is that they're back in the realm of the living and should remember their past life enough to get back to work.
