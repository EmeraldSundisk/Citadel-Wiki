## ![#Bananium](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/a/ac/Bananiumdone.png) What to do
As the clown, your job on station is to provide entertainment to the crew, brightening spirits in an otherwise cold and dangerous place. Being funny is not as easy as it might sound. Use your imagination to come up with the most interesting ways to keep the crew entertained. Heres some good ideas to start;
* Tell jokes over the radio or PDA's
* Play dressup and cosplay your favorite characters using the AutoDrobe found in your own room
* Ask the [HoP](https://katlin.dog/citadel-wiki/main/roles/command/head_of_personnel) for access to places you need to get to brighten departments days
* Beg the [Robotcist](https://katlin.dog/citadel-wiki/main/roles/science/roboticist) to build you honkbots
* Beg the [Shaft Miners](https://katlin.dog/citadel-wiki/main/roles/cargo/shaft_miner) for Bananium and then beg the [Robotcist](https://katlin.dog/citadel-wiki/main/roles/science/roboticist) to build you a HONK mech
* Stick items in peoples pockets
* Take items from peoples pockets
* Create some art for the station, with crayons or spraypaint.
* Write up some of your best clowning stories and then bind them into a book at the library for all to read
* Pick a certain type of item and accrue a collection of it for display
* Team up with assistants to create hidden clown hideouts in maintenance
* Create a newsfeed on the announcers to bring the latest clowning news straight to the crew

Traitor clown suffer from a lack of access, silly shoes and bright clothes, however the upsides to being the deadliest joke on the station are many. For one, doing stupid shit is almost expected of you. A chemist breaking into security? Raise the alert level and descend on his ass. A clown breaking into security? Just your average shift. Your clown shoes can slow you down so be careful waddling about. If caught by security, remember to tell them that its just a prank and they hate fun. You've got your own little room for shady dealings, however your mortal enemy the mime also has access so beware of them blowing any of your hilarious plans in there.

No one takes you seriously. Probably the last mistake they'll ever make.
