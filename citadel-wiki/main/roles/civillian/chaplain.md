The Chaplain
===

**The Chaplain** is effectively a spiritual advisor for the crew, although they still answer to the [Head of Personnel](main/roles/command/head_of_personnel.md) when it comes to mortal employment. Although [recent medical breakthroughs]() have rendered funeral services a rarity, they are still a tremendous asset when it comes to dealing with the occult, be it [bloodthirsty]() or [industrious Cults](), [Wizards](), [Revenants]() or [Devils](). A good chaplain can turn the tide against these threats - beyond that they're about on par with the [Curator](citadel-wiki/main/roles/civillian/curator.md).

## Who Do You Want To Be(lieve) Today?
Remember when customizing your character that you had the option to choose your religion name and deity? No time does that matter more than when you're the Chaplain, as they'll be the source of your power. In fact, your prayers are more likely to be answered than your average crew member - doubly so if you're also [Spiritual]().

**A note from CentCom Higher Dimensional Affairs:** _"Due to concerns over potential conflicts of interest, chaplains are explicitly forbidden from worshipping the deities [Nar'Sie]() or [Ratvar]() in any capacity, even peaceful interpretations."_

Your holy book (which can be customized by using it in your active hand) is not only capable of turning plain water into holy water but also healing the injured (although the latter can come with a side effect of brain damage). That's not the only tool at your disposal - you'll also find an Armaments Beacon inside your ChapDrobe, giving you the choice of the following:

- **Templar Kit:** Contains a set of Templar armor, resembling that of a medieval European crusader.

- **Hospitaller Kit:** A monochrome variant of the Templar armor, better suited for edgelords and [Mimes]().

- **Stone Sentinel Kit:** Contains a set of armor that gives the user a [golem]()-like appearance while worn.

- **Profane Scholar Kit:**

- **Witchhunter's Kit:**

- **Followers of the Chaplain Kit:** Instead of armor, contains a leader hoodie and four follower hoodies.

Lastly, provided a [greytider](citadel-wiki/main/roles/civillian/assistant.md) hasn't beaten you to it you'll also find a null rod in your quarters. Although effective against both cult and wizard magic as-is, it can be reshaped into [numerous forms](), but things to know for quick reference include:

- Lasers fired from a holy lasrifle are only a threat to cultists. Even attempting to execute a non-cultist with one will only do a smidgen of harm, but that's still enough to upset [silicons]().

- Weapons that integrate into your body (chainsaw arm, god hand, etc) will automatically bestow themself upon your successor should you [cryo]() out of the round.

- Prayer beads effectively sacrifice all offensive abilities in exchange for significantly faster [deconversion]() times.

- The only real "wrong" choice is the UNREAL SORD, which only does 4.13 damage. [Who even made this conksuck sord?!]()

## Heresy And You
When the occult strikes, the station will likely come to you in their time of need. A good chaplain will begin production of holy water

...blessing the station at large is a good way to prevent occult activity. As for more specific concerns, here's how to handle some of the (un)usual suspects:

### Deus Cults
Of all the threats you may face, cultists are easily the biggest but fortunately the one you can do the most about. [Command](citadel-wiki/main/roles/command) may entrust you with all (or at least some) access and [Security](citadel-wiki/main/roles/security) will treat you like an equal if not a superior, as holy water can denconvert cultists when fed to them. Unfortunately, you'll be a major target as well. The [Blood Cult]() in particular may be particularly relentless, especially if your sacrifice is required as a part of their ritual. Moreso than usual, try not to die.

### Wizards - Mean Spirited
Wizards fall into a bit of a grey area, as much as ["valid hunters"]() may disagree. Unfortunately more often than not they're [Clowns]() on steroids - amusing themselves at the expense of everyone else. If (when) the wizard proves malicious...

Although quite different in origin, [Revenants]() are a lot like most wizards in that they exist to be **fucking annoying**.

### Dealing with the Devil(s)
While a rare occurrence, admittedly the [Curator](citadel-wiki/main/roles/civillian/curator.md) and (strangely enough, the) [Lawyer]() play a much larger role in dispelling devils than you do. However, you have blessings you may be able to spread to others. Many devils are forbidden from trying to harm you or even set foot in your domain - your mere presence may keep them at bay.

## Divine Apathy
Of course, if all the station faced was the paranormal, it would simply become normal. Some shifts you may find your services aren't particularly needed, and if not an [antagonist](citadel-wiki/main/roles/antagonist) you may be unsure what to do. In these times, you may wish to consider the following:

- **Serving the Chosen Few:** It's always possible there's at least one person on the station willing to hear you out. They may require spiritual guidance or wish to atone for their sins - it's in your interest to humor them.

- **Serving the Masses:** If you want to win people over you could always try helping the station at large. Whether it's growing food or healing the wounded when medical staff are nonexistent, it's at least worth a shot.

- **Mortuary Care:** Even if the dead can be cloned, it still leaves the matter of their old bodies. Sometimes they can really pile up in the morgue, meaning you might want to make use of your chapel's crematorium or holy driver.

- **Rituals and Ceremonies:** Do the kind of things religions are known for! Host funerals and weddings. Listen to confessions! Give sermons, perform rituals, the list goes on.

## Forgive Me For What I Must Do - Antagonist Tips
Given the crew's secular nature, people thinking you can do no wrong is likely out of the question. However, there are some perks to your position:

- Unlike a lot of jobs, people aren't likely to notice (or care) you're not at your post. On some stations people will have to go out of their way to visit you, meaning it's easier to handle things unseen. 

- Many null rod forms are pretty powerful against normal crew members too, and as a chaplain you're normally trusted to wield them.

- Since your holy text can fit booze, it can also be used to conceal similarly-sized items. Besides, what are the odds someone will actually look inside?

- It's technically your job to tend to the dead, so you lugging body bags or coffins around shouldn't faze people. Even if it does, you have a valid excuse to be doing that - just don't tell them the body never reached the medbay.
