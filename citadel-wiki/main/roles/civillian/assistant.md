## ![#Toolbox](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/1/12/BlueToolbox.png) With no power, comes no responsibility
Generally seen as the best job for a brand new player fresh off the shuttle, the assistant has basically no expectations of competency from the rest of the crew. This does not mean you can do whatever you please and are free from scrutiny, remember the rules apply fully, if you need a quick reminder of them you can check them out [here.](https://katlin.dog/citadel-rules/main)

Remember your job is to assist, not to impede, leave the pranks up to the clown. You start out with access to the main areas of the station and maintenance. So feel free to explore and see whats happening around the station and who might be needing a helping hand.

## ![#Grey Jumpsuit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CozmoB/Citadel-Wiki/master/citadel-wiki-static/images/items/not32jump.png)  But what do I do?
For assistant, the role is what you make it and that goes for the fun too. If you're looking to know more about a department you can go ask the crew over there if they'll show you the ropes, or you can go ask the [Head of Personnel](https://katlin.dog/citadel-wiki/main/roles/command/head_of_personnel) for access to a department that needs a hand.

Your best bet to not give into space-boredom is to pick a project for the round and get to work, heres a few idea's but you'll find that every round will have its own needs and whats fun for you might differ. 

* Create an art project using what you can get in the art supply room
* Redecorate a dorm room into your own little fiefdom
* Hang out at the bar for a chat with the patrons
* Ask over the radio if any departments are in need of an extra hand
* Look through maint for any unused crates cargo might want
* Visit the chapel and pray, or see if the chaplain will forgive your endless sins
* ~~ERP~~
* Play the arcade machines around the station and form your own plushie army
* Create your own little store with some tables for all the maint loot you grab
* Ask for EVA access from the [HoP](https://katlin.dog/citadel-wiki/main/roles/command/head_of_personnel) and head into space to explore
* Head to the library and bother the librarian for the lewdest books they have
* Refurbish the maint bar and replace the bartender
* Head to the Holodeck or VR pods for some virtual entertainment
* Destroy the mouse menace in maint and report any broken cables to engineering
* Grab some tools from Primary Tool Storage and help fix up anything thats been broken
* Try not to get murdered


## ![#Gas Mask](https://tgstation13.org/wiki//images/f/f6/Gas_mask.png) Grey Death
The assistant may seem like a useless job to be a traitor as to those unfamiliar, however that couldn't be further from the truth. Some advantages you get as the Grey tide is instant access to maintenance, which right away gives you an ample supply of maint loot, places to hide, places to hide things, possible locations for your own hideouts and bases and a dark area to prowl for your dirty deeds.

Your lack of responsibility ensures no ones going to be asking where you are if you up and disappear for a bit, allowing you to scuttle off to preform your dark deeds. Just remember, no one really trusts assistants, but they can never really be sure until its too late.
